Slider made deeper as on PDF mock up
Right hand column – the title of the block is coming from the child page and not the parent. It will take the parent title if there is one, otherwise use its own.
Check pink colour – R222 G18 B117 de1275 – check ‘Are you Prominent’ home page text - changed throughout.
…
Awards page – tiles should be six across – see artwork – we have lots of awards to add
Awards page – the page needs to be split between ‘our awards’ and 'client awards’ - see artwork

Tiles – is it possible to have solid colour if no image is used on tile? There are too many versions of each colour across the site – maybe swap the resting colour to 100% and the rollover colour to be lighter?

Are you Prominent? - on the home page add more padding between slider and text, make the same as space below text.
Tiles – can we have direct control over what colour each tile is? Randomisation won’t work… - go with your option as discussed – can the options be pink, navy blue and the light grey

Search bar – should we remove this for launch or do you have time to fix? The position needs to be tweaked as sitting too high and not right aligned to the slider. The icon also need to be navy blue. Can search bar work like http://cambridgeshirepeterborough-ca.gov.uk
